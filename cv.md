### About myself

###### I have always enjoyed programming and I would like my code to be useful to me and other people. 
###### I am attracted to web development because the products of this direction are used by a huge number of people. Another reason for my interest in web development is that it allows me to create anything from a single page site to a mini-game. 
###### I want to become a good front-end developer and hope that my studies at RSSchool will give me new knowledge and improve my skills.
